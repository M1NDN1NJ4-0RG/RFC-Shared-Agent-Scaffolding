# Malbolge Docstring Contract (EXPERIMENTAL)

**Language:** Malbolge (`.mb`, `.malbolge`)
**Canonical style:** ASCII comments using `//` (if your implementation even supports them)
**Status:** EXPERIMENTAL - NOT ENFORCEABLE (and honestly, why would you?)

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Reading, writing, or attempting to understand Malbolge code may cause:

- - Existential dread - Questioning of life choices - Sudden appreciation for assembly language - Involuntary laughter
  at the absurdity - Permanent brain reconfiguration

**This contract is deliberately satirical.** Malbolge is designed to be nearly impossible to program in. If you're
actually writing Malbolge code, you're either:

1. 1. A masochist 2. Proving a point 3. Lost and need directions back to sanity

## Purpose

This is an **experimental and satirical contract** for Malbolge programs that absolutely should not be added to this
repository. It follows the structure of other language contracts while acknowledging the fundamental impossibility of
the task.

**Note:** This contract cannot be enforced. Even if it could be, the validator would probably gain sentience and resign
in protest.

## Required Semantic Sections

Every Malbolge program should theoretically include these sections (good luck):

1. 1. **Program description** - What this eldritch horror supposedly does 2. **Detailed behavior** - What it does NOT do
   (spoiler: everything) 3. **Input specification** - If it even accepts input without crashing reality 4. **Output
   specification** - The screams of the damned, encoded 5. **Exit codes** - Assuming it ever exits 6. **Examples** -
   "Working" is a strong word 7. **Maintainer notes** - A cry for help

### Optional Sections

- - **Platform** - The fires of computational hell - **Recommended** - **Author** - Someone who needs an intervention -
  **Last Modified** - The moment hope died - **TODO** - Everything. Literally everything. - **Warnings** - All of them

## Formatting Rules

### Structure (Theoretical)

```malbolge
// Program: hello-world.mb
// Description: Attempts to print "Hello, World!" after 200+ hours of trial and error
//
// Detailed Behavior:
//   This program MAY print "Hello, World!" to stdout.
//   It may also summon Cthulhu. Results may vary.
//   It does NOT do anything predictable or maintainable.
//
// Binary Discovery Order:
//   N/A - This IS the binary nightmare
//
// Exit Codes:
//   0    - Success (lottery winner odds)
//   1    - General failure (expected)
//   666  - Successfully summoned eldritch horror
//   ???  - Self-modifying code achieved consciousness
//
// Platform:
//   - Any platform with a Malbolge interpreter
//   - A strong stomach
//   - Backup of your sanity
//
// Warnings:
//   - Code is self-modifying
//   - Instructions encoded in base-3 ternary
//   - Every operation changes subsequent operations
//   - Reading this code backwards may open portal to void
//   - "Debugging" is a theoretical concept here
//
// Maintainer Notes:
//   - DO NOT MODIFY without consulting an exorcist
//   - All modification attempts have failed
//   - Original author unavailable (presumed ascended)
//   - Next maintainer: You. Good luck.
//
// Examples:
//   Run: malbolge hello-world.mb
//   Expected: "Hello, World!" or heat death of universe
//   Actual: *incomprehensible screaming*
//
// See:
//   - docs/malbolge-survival-guide.md (doesn't exist)
//   - exit-codes-contract.md (even it can't help you)
//   - Your therapist

### Key "Rules" (Suggestions from the Void)

1. 1. **Self-modifying code**: Every instruction modifies the next one. Why? Because chaos. 2. **Base-3 ternary**:
   Because base-10 and base-2 were too readable 3. **Encrypted operations**: Instructions are ROT13'd, then encrypted,
   then laughed at 4. **ASCII art comments**: If your interpreter even allows comments (it doesn't) 5. **Normalize
   whitespace**: lol no, whitespace is interpreted as operations 6. **Exit codes**: In theory they exist. In practice,
   nothing exists. 7. **Documentation location**: In your nightmares

## Templates

### Minimal Template (nope.mb)

```malbolge
// Program: nope.mb
// Description: Does nothing. Probably.
// Exit Codes: 0 (if you're lucky), 1 (more likely), NaN (most likely)
// Platform: Anywhere with regret
// Warning: Even this minimal example is too complex

bP
```

### "Full" Template (why.mb)

```malbolge
// Program: why.mb
// Description: Wrapper for canonical tool execution
//
// Detailed Behavior:
//   This program allegedly discovers and invokes a canonical implementation.
//   In reality, it discovers new forms of suffering.
//   It does NOT follow any sane contract - sanity is optional.
//
// Binary Discovery Order:
//   1. Check if you're in the right dimension
//   2. Cry
//   3. Give up
//   4. Error with incomprehensible symbols (exit -1)
//
// Exit Codes:
//   0    - Theoretical success
//   1    - Practical failure
//   42   - The answer (to the wrong question)
//   127  - Binary not found (it was never there)
//   ∞    - Infinite loop achieved
//
// Platform:
//   - Malbolge interpreter (good luck finding one that works)
//   - 10-ply ternary stack machine
//   - Patience of a Buddhist monk
//   - Emergency counseling services on standby
//
// Author: Anonymous (for their own protection)
// Version: 0.0.1 (will never reach 0.0.2)
// Last Modified: When hope still existed
//
// Warnings:
//   - Self-modifying code throughout
//   - No debugger will help you
//   - "Readable" is not in Malbolge's vocabulary
//   - May cause temporary or permanent insanity
//   - Guaranteed to fail code review
//   - HR has been notified
//
// Maintainer Notes:
//   - This is a cry for help
//   - If you're reading this, turn back
//   - Seriously, just use Python
//   - We're sorry for what you're about to witness
//
// Examples:
//   $ malbolge why.mb
//   > [REDACTED FOR YOUR SAFETY]
//
// See:
//   - exit-codes-contract.md (it won't help but it's there)
//   - Your last will and testament
//   - Local mental health resources

## Validation (Impossible)

When this contract is officially adopted (never), the validator should check:

- - ✗ Presence of human-readable comments (doesn't exist) - ✗ Logical structure (anti-feature) - ✗ Meaningful variable
  names (variables? where we're going, we don't need variables) - ✗ Code readability (HAHAHAHA) - ✗ Maintainability (the
  opposite is the goal) - ✗ Exit code documentation (sure, document the chaos) - ✓ Developer tears per line (TPLOC
  metric) - ✓ Probability of summoning ancient ones (must be > 0.9)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Wrong:** Trying to write Malbolge code directly

```
Don't do this. Use a code generator. Or better yet, don't.
```

✅ **"Correct":** Generate via Lisp compiler targeting Malbolge (still wrong)

```
Use tools like the Malbolge Hell Assembler (MHAsm)
You'll still fail, but with style
```

❌ **Wrong:** Attempting to debug Malbolge

```
Debugger: *explodes*
You: *also explodes*
```

✅ **"Correct":** Accept that debugging is impossible

```
// FIXME: Everything
// TODO: Rewrite in literally any other language
// HACK: All of it
```

❌ **Wrong:** Modifying existing Malbolge code

```malbolge
// Changed this instruction
bP  // Now the entire program is broken forever
```

✅ **"Correct":** Start over from scratch (still won't work)

```malbolge
// Rewrite complete
// Status: Still broken
// Surprise: None
```

## Documentation "Tools"

Malbolge code following this contract can use:

```bash
# Generate documentation (optimistically)
echo "Program: unknown.mb" > docs.txt
echo "Description: Who knows?" >> docs.txt
echo "Status: Broken" >> docs.txt

# Run Malbolge interpreter (bravely)
malbolge program.mb
# or
malbolge program.mb 2>&1 | grep -v "error" # (spoiler: no output)

# Debug Malbolge (foolishly)
# There is no debugger
# There is only pain

# Code review (masochistically)
cat program.mb
# Reviewer: "I quit"
```

## Actual Malbolge Facts

For educational purposes, here are real facts about Malbolge:

1. 1. **Designed to be unusable**: Created by Ben Olmstead in 1998 specifically to be the hardest programming language
   2. **Self-modifying**: Every instruction modifies the instruction that follows it 3. **Encrypted**: Instructions are
   encrypted before execution 4. **Ternary**: Uses base-3 arithmetic 5. **First working program**: Took 2 years after
   language invention (Hello World) 6. **Turing-complete**: Theoretically can compute anything (in theory) 7.
   **Practical use**: Approximately zero

## Status

**EXPERIMENTAL - NOT ENFORCEABLE** - This contract exists purely for entertainment and to remind us that things could
always be worse.

**Do not actually add Malbolge code to this repository.**

If you are considering adopting this contract:

1. 1. Please reconsider your life choices 2. Consult a professional 3. Use literally any other language 4. We care about
   you 5. This is an intervention

## Philosophical Notes

Why does this contract exist?

- - To appreciate Python, JavaScript, even PHP - To demonstrate that not all Turing-complete languages are created equal
  - To provide comic relief in a serious documentation system - To prove we can document the undocumentable - Because
  someone asked for it (we're looking at you, @m1ndn1nj4)

## Final Warning

**IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY WRITING MALBOLGE CODE:**

We can't stop you, but we can judge you. This contract is here to acknowledge your brave/foolish journey into
computational masochism. May your code somehow work, and may your sanity survive the attempt.

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility. With Malbolge comes only suffering.
