## Original Issue
# [EPIC] - `repo_lint` Improvement Plan

This plan outlines prioritized phases to address all findings. Each item includes context, affected components, and suggested fixes.

**NOTE:** All work MUST comply with the Locked-In Human Decisions above.

---

## Phase 1 – Critical Fixes and Corrections (High Priority)

- [x] **Fix repository root detection** (Severity: **High**)  
  - **Context:** `get_repo_root()` and `find_repo_root()` currently require a `.git` directory, causing failures outside Git worktrees.  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/install/install_helpers.py`, `tools/repo_lint/runners/base.py` (or wherever `find_repo_root` is defined).  
  - **Fix Steps:** Modify these functions to check for `.git` but **if not found**, return the current working directory as root (or use an environment override). For example:

    ~~~python
    root = current
    while current != current.parent:
        if (current / ".git").exists():
            root = current
            break
        current = current.parent
    return root
    ~~~

    Ensure `find_repo_root` in all runners uses this updated logic.  
  - **Rationale:** Allows `repo_lint` to run in directories without Git, matching user expectations.

- [x] **Clarify exit codes for unsafe mode** (Severity: **High**)  
  - **Context:** `repo_lint fix --unsafe` in CI or without `--yes-i-know` uses exit code 2 ("Missing tools"), which is misleading.  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py`, in `cmd_fix`.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Introduce a new exit code (e.g. `ExitCode.UNSAFE_VIOLATION = 4`) or reuse code 3 for policy errors. Change the `return ExitCode.MISSING_TOOLS` on lines 22 and 36 of `cmd_fix` to this new code. Update `ExitCode` enum accordingly. Adjust help text to note this code.  
  - **Rationale:** Distinguishes configuration errors from missing tools, making CI logs clearer.

- [x] **Handle partial install failures gracefully** (Severity: **Medium**)  
  - **Context:** In `cmd_install`, if Python tool installation fails, the script still prints next-step instructions but ends with an error. This could confuse users.  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py`, lines around 45–60 in `cmd_install`.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Change logic so that the overall success flag (`success`) is computed across all sections: if Python tools or any manual section fails, show errors but consider whether to continue. For example, do **not** `return ExitCode.INTERNAL_ERROR` immediately upon Python failure; instead, gather errors and only exit at end. Alternatively, exit early but skip printing irrelevant instructions. Update output messages accordingly.  
  - **Rationale:** Improves user experience during tool setup and makes failure reasons clear.

- [x] **Ensure missing docstring validator is detected** (Severity: **Medium**)  
  - **Context:** If `validate_docstrings.py` is missing, runners return a violation with an "script not found" error. This may be unclear.  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/runners/*_runner.py` (each `_run_docstring_validation` implementation).  
  - **Fix Steps:** In `_run_docstring_validation` methods, catch the "script not found" case explicitly. Print a clear error (`"Docstring validation skipped: script not found"`). Optionally, raise a `MissingToolError`. Document this case in README.  
  - **Rationale:** Makes it obvious when docstring checks are not executed.

- [x] **Validate non-Python unsafe mode behavior** (Severity: **Medium**)  
  - **Context:** The `--unsafe` fix path only processes Python files. If a user passes `--only=perl` with `--unsafe`, the logic will not handle it.  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py`, `cmd_fix` unsafe section.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Restrict `--unsafe` to only allow `--only=python` (error out otherwise), or extend unsafe fixer support to other languages (if implemented). At minimum, add a check:

    ~~~python
    if unsafe_mode and args.only and args.only != "python":
        print("❌ Unsafe fixes not supported for this language", file=sys.stderr)
        return ExitCode.MISSING_TOOLS
    ~~~

  - **Rationale:** Prevents silent no-op when unsupported combinations are requested.

- [x] **Add missing unit tests for error conditions** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** Key error branches (missing tools, missing policy file, unsafe mode cases) lack automated tests.  
  - **Affected Files:** Add to `tools/repo_lint/tests/`.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Write tests using `pytest` to simulate: invoking `repo_lint check` without tools (expect exit code 2), `repo_lint fix` with `--unsafe` in CI (exit 2), missing policy (exit 3), etc. Use subprocess calls or invoke `main()` directly.  
  - **Rationale:** Catches regressions early and ensures CLI behavior is documented.

---

## Phase 2 – Major Enhancements and Alignments (Medium Priority)

- [x] **Make `repo_lint` an installable package** (Severity: **Medium**)  
  - **Context:** Future Work (FW-013) calls for packaging the tool.  
  - **Affected Files:** Project root. Need a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`, and modify code as needed.  
  - **Fix Steps:**  
    - Create `pyproject.toml` (or `setup.py`) with package metadata, including `tools/repo_lint` as a module.  
    - Define entry point:

      ~~~toml
      [project.scripts]
      repo-lint = "tools.repo_lint.cli:main"
      ~~~

    - (Alternatively, setuptools `entry_points` in `setup.py`.)  
    - Remove reliance on `python3 -m tools.repo_lint` in docs; update to `repo-lint` command.  
    - Ensure `__main__.py` is present or remove if using entry points.  
  - **Rationale:** Improves usability (one can `pip install -e .`) and aligns with future plan.

- [x] **Integrate naming-and-style enforcement** (Severity: **Medium**)  
  - **Context:** The future work suggests `repo_lint` should enforce filename conventions (kebab-case, etc.). Currently, naming checks are done via CI or manual scripts, not by `repo_lint`.  
  - **Affected Files:** Likely add a new runner or extend an existing one. Could be a new "General" runner that checks all files, or integrate into common checks.  
  - **Fix Steps:**  
    - Define a "NamingRunner" (or add to `common.py`) that loads naming rules (from `docs/contributing/naming-and-style.md` or encode them).  
    - In `check()`, gather all files and verify their names match regex per-language (e.g. Python `.py` files snake_case, non-scripts kebab-case).  
    - Report violations via `LintResult`.  
    - Optionally, add a fix mode: e.g. suggest renames (though renaming with history is non-trivial, so perhaps only report).  
    - Add test fixtures in repo-lint tests for naming violations.  
  - **Rationale:** Automates an important repository convention and prevents drift.

- [x] **Pin external tool versions in installer** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** We have `install/version_pins.py` with desired versions (Black, etc.), but `install_python_tools` currently installs latest (via `requirements-dev.txt`).  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/install/install_helpers.py` and `install/version_pins.py`.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Use the version pins: in `install_python_tools`, instead of a generic pip install, construct commands like `pip install black=={version}` using the pins. Alternatively, generate a `requirements.txt` with pinned versions. Ensure `pip install .` or `requirements-dev.txt` uses these pins.  
  - **Rationale:** Guarantees deterministic linting behavior.

- [x] **Improve CLI usability** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** Minor enhancements for user experience.  
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py`, README.  
  - **Fix Steps:**  
    - Add better help text for `--only` and `--yes-i-know`.  
    - Document the `repo-lint` command in the main README or a Usage doc.  
    - Consider allowing configuration file (e.g. `.repo-lint.yaml`) for default options (suggestion, not required by contract).  
  - **Rationale:** Makes tool easier to adopt and reduces on-boarding friction.

---

## Phase 3 – Polish, Nits, and Minor Improvements (Low Priority)

- [ ] **Code style clean-up** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** Address minor style issues flagged by linters.  
  - **Affected Files:** All Python files under `tools/repo_lint`.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Run `flake8` or `pylint` on the `repo_lint` package, fix warnings (unused imports, variable names, line lengths). Align formatting with repository norms (e.g. order of imports).  
  - **Rationale:** Improves readability and prevents technical debt.

- [ ] **Add or improve docstrings in the code** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** Given the emphasis on contracts and documentation, the code should be thoroughly documented. Some private methods or CLI helpers lack docstrings.  
  - **Affected Files:** Missing or incomplete docstrings (e.g. CLI parser creation, internal helpers).  
  - **Fix Steps:** Audit all public functions/methods in `repo_lint` for missing documentation. Add descriptive docstrings (Purpose, parameters, return values). Align with reST or Google style per the repository's convention.  
  - **Rationale:** Helps future maintainers and ensures consistency with the project's documentation standards.

- [ ] **Update documentation** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** Once code changes are done, docs should reflect them. For example, after packaging, update instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the Future Work tracker to mark FW-013 as addressed. Any new CLI flags or behaviors should be documented.  
  - **Affected Files:** `docs/README.md`, `docs/future-work.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `tools/repo_lint/README.md`.  
  - **Fix Steps:**  
    - In `docs/future-work.md`, mark FW-013 as complete or remove.  
    - In repo README, add a "Tools" section listing `repo-lint`.  
    - In `CONTRIBUTING.md`, mention running `repo-lint` before PRs.  
    - Ensure all doc links (to examples, RFC, etc.) are up-to-date.  
  - **Rationale:** Keeps documentation accurate and helps onboard contributors.

- [ ] **Test coverage for runners (Optional)** (Severity: **Low**)  
  - **Context:** While we have tests for each runner, they focus on isolated behavior. Integration tests (e.g. simulate a small mixed-language repo) could catch cross-cutting issues.  
  - **Affected Files:** Possibly add new test files.  
  - **Fix Steps:** Create integration tests that run `repo_lint check` on test repos with known violations in multiple languages, verifying combined output.  
  - **Rationale:** Ensures end-to-end functionality remains correct as improvements are made.

## Phase 2.5 – Rich UI "Glow Up" for Console Output + Rich-Click Help (CORE COMPLETE ✅)

**Goal:** Make `repo-lint` feel like a polished terminal application with professional-grade UI.

- [x] **Add UI/Reporter Layer** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** All user-facing output should be routed through a single authoritative UI/reporting interface.
  - **Affected Files:** New: `tools/repo_lint/ui/{__init__,console,reporter,theme}.py`
  - **Implementation:** Created Reporter with methods: `render_header()`, `runner_started()`, `runner_completed()`, `render_results_table()`, `render_failures()`, `render_final_summary()`, `render_config_validation_errors()`
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Extend Data Model for Results** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Need consistent results model for Rich table generation.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/common.py`
  - **Implementation:** Extended `LintResult` with `file_count` and `duration` fields
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Implement Results Rendering** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Rich tables/panels for interactive mode, stable output for CI mode.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/ui/reporter.py`, `tools/repo_lint/reporting.py`
  - **Implementation:** Reporter renders Rich tables in TTY mode, plain tables in CI mode
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Integrate Reporter into CLI** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Replace all direct prints with Reporter calls.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/cli_argparse.py`, `tools/repo_lint/reporting.py`
  - **Implementation:** All output routes through Reporter; `ci_mode` flag passed through
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Rich-Click Integration** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Beautiful help output with styled headings, option groups, examples.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py`, `pyproject.toml`
  - **Implementation:** Click-based CLI with Rich-Click styling, comprehensive help, option grouping
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Theme System** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** User-configurable YAML theme for colors/icons/box styles/help formatting.
  - **Affected Files:** New: `conformance/repo-lint/repo-lint-ui-theme.yaml`, `tools/repo_lint/ui/theme.py`
  - **Implementation:** YAML theme config with strict validation; precedence: flag > env > user config > default
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Update Tests for Rich Format** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** `test_output_format.py` expects plain text; now outputs Rich tables.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/tests/test_output_format.py`
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Windows Validation** (Severity: **High** - BLOCKER)
  - **Context:** MUST validate on Windows PowerShell, PowerShell 7+, Windows Terminal.
  - **Affected Files:** N/A (validation/testing task)
  - **Validation Required:** Help rendering, shell completion, stable CI output
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - CI validation added

- [x] **Documentation Updates** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** Update HOW-TO with theme customization, Windows completion instructions.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/HOW-TO-USE-THIS-TOOL.md`
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Rationale:** Professional UI significantly improves user experience. CI mode maintains determinism.

## Phase 2.6 – Centralized Exception Rules (Planned, NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Add a strict, centralized YAML "exceptions roster" that declares *what to ignore, where, and why* — with strong validation, auditability, and predictable CI behavior — **without removing pragma support**.

**Core Principle:** Exceptions are **data**, not **inline code graffiti**. Pragmas remain supported (backward compatible). The YAML exceptions file becomes a first-class alternative (and preferred in docs).

- [ ] **Create Exceptions Schema & Validator** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Need centralized YAML config for ignore/exceptions with strict validation.
  - **Affected Files:** New: `conformance/repo-lint/repo-lint-exceptions.yaml`, `tools/repo_lint/conformance/exceptions_schema.py`
  - **Requirements:**
    - YAML MUST have `---` and `...` markers
    - MUST include `config_type: repo-lint-exceptions` and `version: 1`
    - Unknown keys at any depth are hard errors
    - Each exception MUST include: `id`, `scope`, `ignores`, `reason`, `owner`, `created`, `expires`, `tracking`
    - Anti-Typo Contract: tools/codes MUST match known values from conformance configs
  - **Rationale:** Centralized exceptions are auditable, expirable, and have clear ownership.

- [ ] **Integrate Exceptions into Results & Reporting** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Filter violations via exceptions YAML before reporting; track ignored counts.
  - **Affected Files:** Results model, reporting layer
  - **Requirements:**
    - Violations carry metadata: tool, code, file, symbol
    - Filter violations before reporting
    - Track: original vs ignored vs remaining counts
    - CI FAIL on expired exceptions; TTY shows red panel
  - **Rationale:** Makes exception usage visible and prevents expired exceptions from going stale.

- [ ] **Keep Pragma Support & Add Conflict Detection** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Pragmas remain fully supported; YAML is additional mechanism.
  - **Affected Files:** CLI, runners
  - **Requirements:**
    - Pragmas remain supported (no breaking changes)
    - Add pragma warning toggle (configurable)
    - If YAML + pragma conflict → ALWAYS warn (even if warnings disabled)
    - Precedence: YAML exceptions > pragmas (deterministic)
  - **Rationale:** Backward compatibility while encouraging centralized approach.

- [ ] **Implement Symbol/Scope Matching** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** Exceptions need to target specific modules, classes, functions, files, paths, globs.
  - **Affected Files:** Exception application logic
  - **Requirements:**
    - Python: module + qualified name matching
    - PowerShell/Bash/Perl/Rust: file/path scoping (AST symbol optional)
    - Regex matching with explicit anchoring requirements
  - **Rationale:** Precise targeting prevents over-broad exceptions.

- [ ] **Add Documentation for Exceptions** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** Users need clear guidance on YAML exceptions vs pragmas.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/HOW-TO-USE-THIS-TOOL.md`
  - **Requirements:**
    - Add "Exceptions YAML" section with schema examples
    - Document "Pragmas remain supported" explicitly
    - Document pragma warning toggle behavior
    - Document conflict rules and precedence
  - **Rationale:** Clear documentation ensures adoption and correct usage.

- [ ] **Add Exception Tests** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Validate exception application, expiration, conflicts.
  - **Affected Files:** New test files
  - **Requirements:**
    - Validator tests: missing markers, wrong config_type, bad regex, expired exceptions
    - Integration tests: violations + exceptions (counts verified), pragma + YAML conflicts
  - **Rationale:** Ensures exceptions work correctly and catch regressions.

**Rationale:** Centralized exceptions with expiration and audit trails prevent "eternal mold" and improve maintainability.

## Phase 2.7 – Extended CLI Granularity & Reporting ✅ CORE COMPLETE (7/8 items)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (with 1 remaining item: config CLI commands)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-01

**Goal:** Add extremely granular CLI options for filtering, output control, and robust reporting.

**Mandatory Features:**

- [x] **Add Language and Tool Filtering** (Severity: **High**) ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Users need to run specific tools on specific languages.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py`, runner base classes
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ `--lang <LANG>`: filter to single language (python, bash, perl, powershell, rust, yaml, all)
    - ✅ `--tool <TOOL>`: filter to specific tool(s) - repeatable
    - ✅ Tool availability validation with correct exit codes
    - ✅ Missing tools exit with code 2
  - **Testing:** 25/25 Phase 2.7 tests pass

- [x] **Add Summary Modes** (Severity: **High**) ✅ COMPLETE (FIXED Critical Bug)
  - **Context:** Users need different levels of output detail.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/reporting.py`, `tools/repo_lint/ui/reporter.py`
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ `--summary`: normal output + compact summary at end
    - ✅ `--summary-only`: ONLY compact summary (no per-file details)
    - ✅ `--summary-format <MODE>`: short, by-tool, by-file, by-code (all 4 modes working)
  - **Bug Fixed:** Rich markup error in CI mode causing MarkupError (empty color tags)
  - **Testing:** All summary mode tests pass

- [x] **Add Verbosity Controls** (Severity: **Medium**) ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Prevent terminal spam; allow fine-tuned output.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/reporting.py`, `tools/repo_lint/ui/reporter.py`
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ `--max-violations <N>`: hard cap for detailed items printed
    - ✅ `--show-files` / `--hide-files`: per-file breakdown control
    - ✅ `--show-codes` / `--hide-codes`: tool rule IDs/codes control
    - ✅ `--fail-fast`: stop after first tool failure
  - **Testing:** Display control tests pass

- [x] **Add Output Formats & Report Generation** (Severity: **High**) ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Need structured output for humans and CI artifacts.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/reporting.py` with full format handlers
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ `--format <FMT>`: rich (TTY default), plain (CI default), json, yaml, csv, xlsx
    - ✅ `--report <PATH>`: write consolidated report to disk
    - ✅ `--reports-dir <DIR>`: write per-tool reports + index summary
    - ✅ JSON/YAML schemas stable
    - ✅ CSV output: summary.csv, violations.csv (full implementation)
    - ✅ XLSX output: report.xlsx with multiple sheets (full implementation with openpyxl)
  - **Testing:** Output format tests pass (xlsx skipped if openpyxl not installed)

- [x] **Add Fix-Mode Safety Features** (Severity: **High**) ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Fixing should be safe and predictable.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py` fix command
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ `--dry-run`: show what would change without modifying files
    - ✅ `--diff`: show unified diff previews (TTY-only)
    - ✅ `--changed-only`: restrict to git-changed files (error if no git)
  - **Testing:** Fix mode tests pass

- [x] **Add `repo-lint doctor` Command** (Severity: **High**) ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Need comprehensive environment + config sanity check.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/doctor.py` (full implementation)
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ Checks: repo root, venv, tool registry, config validity, tool availability, PATH
    - ✅ Flags: `--format` (rich/plain/json/yaml), `--report`, `--ci`
    - ✅ Exit 0 if all green, 1 if any red
    - ✅ Output: green/red checklist with detailed diagnostics
  - **Testing:** Doctor command verified working

- [ ] **Implement External Configuration Contract (YAML-First)** (Severity: **High**) ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Maximize user-configurability while preserving contract safety.
  - **Implementation Status:**
    - ✅ All configurable behavior IS in YAML (conformance/repo-lint/*.yaml)
    - ✅ Strict validation: `---`/`...` markers, `type`/`version` fields, unknown keys fail (config_validator.py)
    - ✅ YAML-first architecture fully implemented (yaml_loader.py)
    - ❌ `--config <PATH>`: explicit config file - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
    - ❌ `--dump-config`: print fully-resolved config - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
    - ❌ `--validate-config <PATH>`: validate without running - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
    - ❓ In `--ci`: config auto-discovery behavior not explicitly documented
  - **Note:** Core YAML-first requirement is MET. Missing CLI convenience commands for config management.
  - **Recommendation:** Add config management commands in follow-up PR.

- [x] **Add Tool Registry & Discoverability Commands** (Severity: **Medium**) ✅ COMPLETE
  - **Context:** Users need to discover what languages/tools are supported.
  - **Implementation:** `tools/repo_lint/cli.py` with registry commands
  - **Delivered:**
    - ✅ `list-langs` command: prints supported `--lang` values
    - ✅ `list-tools` command: prints supported tools (all or per-language via `--lang`)
    - ✅ `tool-help <TOOL>` command: prints tool info (description, language, fix-capable, version, config)
    - ✅ Tool registry derived from conformance configs (single source of truth)
  - **Testing:** Tool registry commands verified working

**Summary:**
- ✅ 7/8 major items COMPLETE and tested
- ⚠️ 1 item PARTIALLY COMPLETE (YAML-first architecture exists; missing 3 CLI convenience commands)
- 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Rich markup error in CI mode for all summary formats
- ✅ 25/25 Phase 2.7 unit tests passing
- ✅ End-to-end CLI verification successful

**Remaining Work:**
- Implement `--config <PATH>` flag for explicit config file selection
- Implement `--dump-config` command for debugging
- Implement `--validate-config <PATH>` command for pre-flight validation
- Document CI mode config behavior explicitly

**Rationale:** Granular control enables both power users and CI/CD integration.

## Phase 2.8 – Environment & PATH Management (Planned, NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Add commands to help users manage venv/PATH setup for `repo-lint` without automatic rc file editing.

**Mandatory Features:**

- [ ] **Add `repo-lint env` Command** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Shell integration helper that prints/writes PATH snippets.
  - **Affected Files:** New CLI command, new modules under `tools/repo_lint/env/`
  - **Requirements:**
    - `--print` (default): print instructions + shell snippet
    - `--install`: write snippet file to user config dir + print manual rc line
    - `--shell [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]`: select snippet type
    - `--venv <path>`: explicit venv path
    - `--path-only`: print ONLY PATH line (automation-friendly)
    - Snippet locations: `~/.config/repo-lint/shell/` (Linux/macOS), `%APPDATA%\repo-lint\shell\` (Windows)
    - MUST NOT auto-edit rc files
  - **Rationale:** Explicit opt-in for persistent PATH changes.

- [ ] **Add `repo-lint activate` Command** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Convenience launcher that spawns subshell with venv activated.
  - **Affected Files:** New CLI command
  - **Requirements:**
    - `--venv <path>`: explicit venv path
    - `--shell [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|cmd]`: subshell to launch
    - `--command "<cmd>"`: run single command (no interactive shell)
    - `--no-rc`: start subshell without loading user rc files
    - `--print`: print exact underlying command
    - `--ci`: disallow interactive subshell; require `--command`
  - **Rationale:** Immediately usable venv without manual activation.

- [ ] **Add `repo-lint which` Command** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** Diagnostic helper for PATH/venv confusion.
  - **Affected Files:** New CLI command
  - **Requirements:**
    - Print table with: repo root, resolved venv, bin/scripts dir, activation script, resolved `repo-lint` executable, Python executable, sys.prefix/base_prefix, detected shell
    - `--json`: machine-readable output with stable keys
    - Warn if `shutil.which("repo-lint")` doesn't match resolved venv
  - **Rationale:** One-liner debug for PATH issues.

- [ ] **Implement Shared Venv Resolution Utility** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Single source of truth for venv detection.
  - **Affected Files:** New shared utility module
  - **Requirements:**
    - Precedence: `--venv` flag > `.venv/` under repo root > current Python venv (sys.prefix) > error
    - Cross-platform path detection (bin/ vs Scripts/)
    - Clear error messages with remediation guidance
  - **Rationale:** Consistent venv resolution across all commands.

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Validation** (Severity: **High** - BLOCKER)
  - **Context:** MUST validate on Linux/macOS + Windows (PowerShell, PowerShell 7+, Windows Terminal).
  - **Affected Files:** N/A (validation/testing task)
  - **Requirements:**
    - Validate env/activate/which on all platforms
    - Validate shell completion installation instructions
    - Validate snippet generation accuracy
  - **Rationale:** Cross-platform reliability is essential for adoption.

- [ ] **Update Documentation** (Severity: **Medium**)
  - **Context:** Users need clear guidance on env/activate/which usage.
  - **Affected Files:** `tools/repo_lint/HOW-TO-USE-THIS-TOOL.md`
  - **Requirements:**
    - Add section "Making repo-lint available in your shell"
    - Add section "Debugging PATH / venv issues with `repo-lint which`"
    - Include examples for bash/zsh/fish/powershell
    - Clarify why rc edits are manual (by design)
  - **Rationale:** Clear documentation improves onboarding.

**Rationale:** Explicit PATH/venv management improves usability without hostile automatic modifications.

## Phase 2.9 – Mandatory Integration & YAML-First Contracts (Cross-Cutting) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Ensure all helper scripts are integrated into `repo-lint` and all configuration is YAML-first.

**Mandatory Requirements:**

- [x] **Integrate External Helper Scripts** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Any helper scripts invoked by `repo-lint` MUST be integrated into the package.
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All helpers integrated, no external scripts remain
  - **Requirements:**
    - Helpers MUST live under `tools/repo_lint/` namespace
    - Helpers MUST have stable, testable Python API
    - Configuration MUST use conformance YAML system
    - Invocation MUST be centralized (no ad-hoc subprocess strings)
    - Helpers MUST be documented in HOW-TO
    - Helpers MUST have unit tests (success paths, failure modes, output schema)
    - Fail fast if external helper detected but not integrated
  - **Rationale:** No "mystery helper scripts"; everything is first-class.

- [x] **Migrate to YAML-First Configuration** (Severity: **High**)
  - **Context:** Maximize configurability while preserving contracts.
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - PR #207 merged, all configs migrated to YAML
  - **Completed Work:**
    - Created `tools/repo_lint/yaml_loader.py` (276 lines)
    - Created `conformance/repo-lint/repo-lint-file-patterns.yaml`
    - Migrated version pins from hardcoded constants to YAML
    - Migrated file patterns from hardcoded constants to YAML
    - Migrated exclusions from hardcoded constants to YAML
    - Added backward compatibility with deprecation warnings
    - Single source of truth: all configs in `conformance/repo-lint/*.yaml`
  - **Requirements:**
    - All configurable behavior MUST be in YAML (not hard-coded constants or ad-hoc env vars)
    - Strict validation enforced
    - CLI flags override config but cannot violate contracts
    - Contract-critical behavior MUST NOT be disable-able
  - **Rationale:** Centralized, validated configuration prevents drift and improves maintainability.

**Rationale:** Cross-cutting contracts ensure consistency and quality across all features.

## Session Notes (newest first)

### 2025-12-31 06:41 - Consolidated Phase 2.5-2.9 into Canonical Overview ✅

**Session Complete:**
- ✅ Consolidated all external documents into single canonical `160-overview.md`
- ✅ Created `160-human-decisions-2.md` for human review (10 major decisions)
- ✅ Updated Progress Tracker to reflect actual completion state
- ✅ Updated `160-next-steps.md` with current blockers and next actions

**Documents Consolidated:**
- `160-phase-2-point-5-rich-glow-up.md` → Phase 2.5 section in overview
- `160-phase-2-point-6-pragmas-sucks.md` → Phase 2.6 section in overview  
- `repo-lint-feature-set.md` → Phase 2.7 and 2.8 sections in overview

**New Phase Structure:**
- Phase 2.5: Rich UI "Glow Up" (CORE COMPLETE - 6/9 items; Windows validation BLOCKER)
- Phase 2.6: Centralized Exception Rules (NOT STARTED - awaiting human decision)
- Phase 2.7: Extended CLI Granularity & Reporting (NOT STARTED - awaiting human decision)
- Phase 2.8: Environment & PATH Management (NOT STARTED - awaiting human decision)
- Phase 2.9: Mandatory Integration & YAML-First Contracts (NOT STARTED - awaiting human decision)

**Key Changes:**
- Normalized all requirements to use explicit MUST/SHOULD/MAY language
- Added severity markers (High/Medium/Low) for all items
- Marked blockers explicitly (Windows validation for Phase 2.5)
- Created comprehensive human decision document (10 decisions covering priorities, scope, trade-offs)

**Human Decisions Required:**
- Phase 2.5 Windows validation: Blocker or deferred?
- Phase 2.6-2.9 prioritization and sequencing
- YAML-first configuration scope and aggressiveness
- Pragma policy for centralized exceptions
- CLI complexity vs usability trade-offs
- Output format support (json/yaml/csv/xlsx)
- `repo-lint doctor` command scope
- Environment commands priority
- Phase 2.9 integration contract timing
- Testing strategy and coverage requirements

**Files Changed:**
- `docs/ai-prompt/160/160-overview.md`: Consolidated all content, updated progress tracker
- `docs/ai-prompt/160/160-next-steps.md`: Updated with Phase 2.5 blockers and human decision requirement
- `docs/ai-prompt/160/160-human-decisions-2.md`: Created (16KB, 10 major decisions)

**Rationale:**
- Per task requirements: merge all external phase documents into canonical overview
- Eliminate duplication and ambiguity
- Ensure single source of truth for Issue #160
- Surface decisions requiring human input before proceeding

**Next Steps:**
- Await human decisions on Phase 2.5 Windows validation approach
- Await human decisions on Phase 2.6-2.9 priorities
- Complete Phase 2.5 blockers once direction is clear
- Do NOT proceed to Phase 2.6+ until human sign-off received
