# Cargo configuration for cross-compilation
#
# This file configures linkers for cross-compilation targets.
# Currently used for building Linux ARM64 binaries on x86_64.
#
# Prerequisites for ARM64 cross-compilation:
# - gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu must be installed on the build system
#   (e.g., via `sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` on Debian/Ubuntu)
