# Workflow: Test PowerShell Bundle
#
# Purpose: Runs conformance tests for the PowerShell implementation of safe-run
# wrapper on Windows. Validates that the PowerShell wrapper correctly delegates
# to the Rust canonical binary and follows M0 contract specifications.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Rust canonical binary (built and staged at dist/windows/x86_64/safe-run.exe)
# - PowerShell (built into Windows)
# - Pester 5.0+ (PowerShell testing framework)
# - PowerShell test suite (RunTests.ps1)
#
# Triggers:
# - Pull requests modifying PowerShell bundle, conformance data, or this workflow
# - Pushes to main branch affecting the same paths
# - Manual workflow dispatch
#
# Note: Runs on windows-latest (PowerShell is Windows-native)
#
# Outputs:
# - Status check: "Test PowerShell Bundle"
# - Artifacts: None (test logs printed to stdout)
# - Side effects: Fails if tests fail
#
# Notes:
# - Required for merge
# - Exit 0 = tests pass, non-zero = tests fail

  # Job: PowerShell Bundle Tests
  # Builds Rust canonical tool on Windows, stages it, installs Pester, runs tests
  test:
    name: PowerShell Bundle Tests
    # Runner: Windows latest (provides PowerShell, Rust toolchain)
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository to access PowerShell bundle and Rust source
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Rust stable toolchain for building canonical binary on Windows
      - name: Set up Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

      # Step 3: Build Rust canonical tool in release mode
      # Produces safe-run.exe on Windows (not safe-run)
      - name: Build Rust canonical tool
        working-directory: rust
        run: cargo build --release -p safe-run

      # Step 4: Stage Rust binary at standard Windows discovery location
      # PowerShell wrapper uses $env:SAFE_RUN_BIN to locate this binary
      # Uses pwsh shell for PowerShell-native commands
      - name: Stage Rust binary for wrapper discovery
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path dist/windows/x86_64

      # Step 5: Install Pester testing framework
      # Pester 5.0+ required for modern PowerShell testing features
      # -SkipPublisherCheck: Bypass publisher validation for faster install
      # -Force: Install without prompts
      # -Scope CurrentUser: Install for current user only (no admin required)

      # Step 6: Run PowerShell test suite
      # Executes RunTests.ps1 which runs all Pester tests in tests/ directory
      # Uses -NoProfile to avoid loading user profile scripts
      # Test runner sets $env:SAFE_RUN_BIN to point to staged Rust binary
