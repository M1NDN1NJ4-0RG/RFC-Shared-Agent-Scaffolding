# Workflow: Phase 3 Windows Ctrl-C Probe
#
# Purpose: Determines real Ctrl-C behavior of safe-run.ps1 wrapper on native Windows
# by programmatically sending console control events and capturing exit codes + logs.
#
# Context:
# - safe-run.ps1 wraps the Rust safe-run canonical tool
# - Contract intent: Ctrl-C should yield ABORTED log and exit code 130 (SIGINT) or 143 (SIGTERM)
# - Risk: PowerShell may throw PipelineStoppedException and catch {} may convert to exit 127
#
# This workflow gathers hard evidence of actual behavior on windows-latest runner.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Rust stable toolchain (for building safe-run.exe)
# - PowerShell (built into Windows)
# - Probe script: wrappers/powershell/tests/phase3-ctrlc-probe.ps1
#
# Status: DISABLED
# - Workflow preserved for future testing on actual Windows machines
# - Currently experiencing CreateProcessW error 123 in CI that requires local debugging
# - To re-enable, uncomment the trigger events below
#
# Triggers:
# - Manual workflow dispatch (primary use case for investigation)
# - Pull requests (optional, for automated validation during development)
# - Pushes to main (optional, for regression tracking)
#
# Outputs:
# - Uploaded artifacts containing:
#   - SAFE_LOG_DIR contents (ABORTED logs if created)
#   - probe-summary.txt (exit code, log presence, observations)
#
# Notes:
# - This workflow is currently DISABLED due to CI environment issues
# - Preserved for future investigation on actual Windows hardware
# - Not required for merge

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository to access PowerShell scripts and Rust source
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Rust stable toolchain for building canonical binary on Windows
      - name: Set up Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

      # Step 3: Build Rust canonical tool in release mode
      # Produces safe-run.exe on Windows
      - name: Build Rust canonical tool
        working-directory: rust
        run: cargo build --release -p safe-run

      # Step 4: Run Phase 3 Ctrl-C probe script
      # Probe script will:
      # - Set SAFE_RUN_BIN to built safe-run.exe
      # - Set SAFE_LOG_DIR to temp directory
      # - Launch safe-run.ps1 with long-lived child command
      # - Send Ctrl-C signal programmatically
      # - Record exit code and check for ABORTED log
      # - Write summary to probe-summary.txt
