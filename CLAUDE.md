# CLAUDE.md — Obsolete Bootstrap (Read First)

This document describes a historical *sharded* agent-instruction and *journaled* work-tracker system that is **no longer authoritative** for this repository.

The current, canonical instructions for all agents are defined in:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Follow **only** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for:

- Operational rules and non‑negotiables
- Repository workflow, CI, and validation steps
- Any agent behavior, routing, or work-tracking guidance

Any `.docs/agent/*` or `.docs/journal/*` content that may exist in this repository (or in `docs/history/ai-agent-guidelines/`) should be treated as **archival documentation only**, not as live instructions.

If there is ever a conflict between this file and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file **wins**.

This file is kept only to provide context about the previous architecture and to explain why older references to `.docs/agent/*` or `.docs/journal/*` must be ignored in favor of the current, unified instructions.
